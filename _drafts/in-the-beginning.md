In The Beginning
================

My own website.
---------------

It was about time that I put the effort into it (well, not much as of this writing)

I believe that I need an online presence, both to show my skills, knowledge, and stupid ideas, as to give my self a platform where to put ideas. Ideas, after all, are fleeting, and they need to be recorded, so I can either expand them or eliminated them from my mind. Not all ideas are useful, or interesting, but they should be given a chance, and opportunity to bloom, before they are mercilesly put down.

Now, some of what I will write is not fully of my own making, not everyone has new ideas all the time. Or as the saying goes: All tales have been written. But I will definitely try to write about what I have already given some thought. I will not be a parrot repeating what others have written or said verbatim.

And that is why this website is here.

Tech
----

In terms of technology, i have decided to use Jekyll for this website. There are a couple of  reasons for it. Which, of course, I will procceed to enumerate. What is the point otherwise.

First, there is the point of limited time. I was working on creating my website from scratch. But there is not that much time available during the day, and there is more interesting code to write. Furthermore, when I wasn't looking at writing a general solution that other people could apply.

Secondly, as i was looking for the tech, the basic idea of being able to deploy as you check-in into github, is appealing. You know, Continuous Delivery and all that Jazz. I love the idea of having a history of changes that I have done to my blog posts and (hopefully) essays.


Thirdly, the initial provider that I have chosen, Digital Ocean, has some help about doing this automated deployment.

Lastly, it was about time to start putting my thoughts out here. With my own website, I would still be a bit away from doing it.


Will I add anything fancy into the website? Bootstrap? Angular? Any other fancy stuff? I do not know. Will see as I try to do things. Though my initial idea is to keep it as simple as possible.

Style
-----

My style, I expect, will evolve as I write new posts. But I want to do describe a few idionsyncrasies of the how I will express myslef, because I don't think here will be a change onn them.

As much as possible I will try to create thoughful posts, in which I put forth opinions derived and supported by facts and experience. Not all is measurable, but I will try to offer some kind of measures wheere possible. Sometimes I will write a few opinions as absolutes. I will strongly believe in them. But I am not omniscient. I recognise the fallability of my thinking, and will change if enough support through facts and experience shows me that I was wrong.

Don't expect rants or trolling. I prefer that my writing is level-headed.

Till Later
----------

And with this, I have to say "Next time, more". Hopefully as you arrive here will find intersting posts that will inform or entertaing you.
