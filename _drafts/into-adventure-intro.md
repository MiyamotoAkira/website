### What is this
This, and a a number of other posts that will follow, have come about after starting a presentation called "Into Adventure - moving from Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to Functional Programming (FP)". They are an expansion of the ideas and points of the talk.

### The road to Functional Programming
A long, long time ago, in a galaxy ... Well, a few years back I started investigating functional programming. The first thing that made me interested was a quote by Eric S. Raymond:

> Lisp is worth learning for the profound enlightenment experience you will have when you finally get it; that experience will make you a better programmer for the rest of your days, even if you never actually use Lisp itself a lot.

Then came the posts by Paul Graham. Well, I actually read first his compilation book "Hackers and Painters". Not sure if it was a recommended reading at University, or I saw the name of the book in a bookshop and it piqued my curiosity. He had one post (or several, for that matter) in which he talked about the startup that he co-founded, ViaWeb. One of the things that he mentioned was, as a startup, you need every single advantage that you could muster and that, for them, the language that they choose to use was important.

Although I do agree that having a good team is far more important, if two companies have equally (or similarly equal) good teams, then the tooling becomes of relevance. Of course, marketing is important.

But I stayed on OOP land. C# mostly, as it is the language that I have used professionally for the last 8 years, then some Python at home (which I prefer).

Until two things happened:

- First one was reading "Seven languages in seven weeks". Well, half reading it. But it was a starting point.
- The second was the presentation done by Uncle Bob at NDC London 2013 about functional programming.

So I decided to get myself finally into it, properly.

### The Posts

Here is the list of posts related to this adventure. I will try to talk about a single point on each post, to not muddle too much the points.

One last warning: The only element of the ones that I'm going to show that is exclusive to FP is immutability of state. The rest can be found in other paradigms.
