### What is this
This, and a a number of other posts that will follow, have come about after starting working on a presentation about moving from Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to Functional Programming (FP). There are an expansion of what I have in the talk. Well, in fact, the talk is a contraction of what I will be writing on these posts.

### The road to Functional Programming
A long, long time ago, in a galaxy ... Well, a few years back I started investigating functional programming. The first thing that made me interested was a quote by Eric S. Raymond:
> Lisp is worth learning for the profound enlightenment experience you will have when you finally get it; that experience will make you a better programmer for the rest of your days, even if you never actually use Lisp itself a lot.

Then came the posts by Paul Graham. Well, rather the book "Hackers and Painters"

But I stayed on OOP land. C# mostly, then some Python.

Until two things happened:

- First one was reading "Seven languages in seven weeks". Well, half reading it. But it was a starting point.
- The second was the presentation done by Uncle Bob at NDC London 2013 about functional programming.

So I decided to get myself finally into it.

### The Posts

Here is the list of posts related to this adventure.
