### Motivation

Slashdot.org post.

### The

I read Extreme Programming Explained, by Kent Beck, when I was at University. Nothing of what he wrote on it was explained at University. Nothing about test, nor tight feedback loops with the client, nor any of the rest.

There are ideas that I tend to latch into, and will remember them at a later point (usually some years later) and will try to act upon them. XP has been one of them.

### The first graduate job

After finishing University I joined DSI (which changed then the name to DSICmm, then Innovative Output Solutions and finally become DST UK). The job that started doing there had the benefit that I was exposed to very rapid feeback loop with the clients. You could send proofs a few times a day, depending on the job. The stark difference with my previous job was quite stark. It was very easy.

Continuous Integration

Tests

Daily?

But there was one that I couldn't practice: Pair Programming.

### My current work

After a bit of being in a nebulous?? position I become more integrated with one of our API teams. There, I have started to finally use some pair programming.

### My findings

Pros:
Easier to concentrate for longer on the task.

Cons:

### The people against it
