title: 10 times programmer

The Intro
---------

I don't remember the first time that I heard (or rather read) about the 10x programmer. But I know the context in which I did: 10x programmer is the cowboy coder that costs more in the long run.

I have not read the original research that brought the idea where it is described the difference between programmers. I have read, though, [Peopleware]() and quite a few number of articles and blogs to the matter. 

Some thoughs
------------

Let's do some reducionist logic. Let's say there is no 10x programmer. Surely, if there is no 10x programmer, then there is no 9x programmer. If there is no 10x programmer, surely you can't consider someone that is nearly as good. If there is no 9x programmer, then there is no 8x programmer. If you continue, then there is no 7x, 6x, 5x, 4x, 3x or 2x programmer. Therefore, all programmers are equal, and no one is better than any other. Therefore, all programmers are interchangeable.

Clearly, if you have worked even 5 minutes in a professional environment that last two sentences on the previous paragraph can be identified as false. Not two programmers are equal, some are better, some are worse. And then it becomes a matter of actually quantifing how much better. And if a programmer is twice as good as another programmer, why there cannot be a programmer that is three times as good?. And if there is a programmer that is three times as good, why there cannot be a programmer that is four times as good? So, is it possible that there is a programmer that is 10x better than another programmer? I do believe that is possible. Chances that it happens? Well, it will depend on your baseline.

When people dismiss the idea of the 10x programmer, most of the articles/blogs/tweets I have read they talked dismissively of a person that coded very fast, but left a mess behind for someone else to sort.

I wouldn't use that as a definition of a better programmer. Is not about the typing speed, but about the quality of the code, defined in terms of correctness, robustness, adaptability and clarity. A programmer is not someone that follows a very specific set of instructions but thinks and takes decisions and do design choices.

The other, and very correct, annoyance with 10x programmer is its use by recruitment. A "rockstar programmer", a "10x programmer". Those people don't have a clue of what they are trying to get. My experience with recruiters have not been very good, and curerntly I only contemplate the use of Stack Careers for it.
