At some point I will go back to writing a blog post showing something of Emacs. But meanwhile, a topic for which just had some talks with colleagues.

# The Setup
I started programming Eons ago. But I didn't have dedicated testers until 5 years ago or so. Most of the time I was doing QA (really badly) on my code, with support at times (which was necessary). Then I started to have some testers, and it was clear to me that they rock. Where I lack the skill/discipline to evaluate multiple options, they have it on spades.

# TDD and any other automated tests
I strongly believe in TDD and automated tests because I have seen the effects of having it: getting quicker to implement a correct version of the application, making my code simpler to change, reducing the amount of regressions introduced (or eliminating all together when I had good coverage), reducing the amount of wasted time, ...

At the moment, I find them necessary to develop. Granted, there are areas where they don't fit, mostly around Graphical elements.

# The traditional QA process
Usually QA happened (well, lots of places still happens) after main development has been done.
