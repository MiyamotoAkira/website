For this post I am going to look at three nice looping constructs on Terraform ([for](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/expressions.html#for-expressions), [for_each]() and [dynamic](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/expressions.html#dynamic-blocks)) and the cartesian product function [setproduct](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/functions/setproduct.html)


# Before on Terraform
[count](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration-0-11/interpolation.html)

# The goodies introducted on 0.12

Breaking change from 0.11

# The For looping
# For_each, Resources and Dynamic
