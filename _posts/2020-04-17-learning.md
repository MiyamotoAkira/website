Long time ago I took a decision. I decided to stay at the company I was, because of a slightly more money that was being offered compared to another offer I had in front of me. The offer would have put me working in Central London 4 years earlier than I end being, and I would have meant that, even I would have been using the same language (C#), I would have been using quite a different tooling set, a completely different architecture and a completely different Business Domain. Once I moved (I did move to a place that payed less) I only kept thinking about the 2 or 3 years of my career I lost staying. (I did win some good friends with whom I still communicate, so from the social aspect it was a gain).

But you can see there is a small difference the amount extra I stayed on the company, but didn't thing that all 4 years were a waste. That was because I kind of got lucky, and after getting my Scrum Certification (the certification is rubbish, but the two days learning properly about Scrum was illuminating), I was able to put into practices the use of Scrum and of technical practices that I have been learning. During that time I read [Clean Code](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3735293-clean-code), [Refactoring](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44936.Refactoring), [Working Effectively with Legacy Code](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44919.Working_Effectively_with_Legacy_Code), [The Art of Unit Testing: With Examples in .Net](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6487349-the-art-of-unit-testing), [Test-Driven Development: By Example](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/387190.Test_Driven_Development), [The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4099.The_Pragmatic_Programmer), and a few others. I was not learning at my company, but I was learning on my own, and I was able to apply my learning. And did it show that what I was learning was, indeed, useful.


Executive 1 - What if we teach them and they leave?
Executive 2 - What if we don't and they stay?
